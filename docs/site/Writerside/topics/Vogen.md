How this documentation is organized:

Tutorials—take you by the hand through a series of steps to create an application that uses Vogen.
Start here if you’re new to Vogen. 

Topic guides—discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information 
and explanation.

Reference guides-contains technical reference for Vogen usage, describing how it works and how to use it. 
The Assumption is that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.

How-to guides—recipes guiding you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. 
They are more advanced than tutorials, and they assume some knowledge of how Vogen works.
